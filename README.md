# üëã Welcome to the NEAR DevHub!

[NEAR DevHub](http://devgovgigs.near.social) is a decentralized community platform for NEAR developers to contribute to the ecosystem and stay informed on the latest topics. It enables anyone to share ideas, match solutions, and access technical support and funding. The Developer DAO team is actively developing the DevHub and welcoming open contributions from the community. We strive to maintain a transparent and efficient process for all.  

This repository holds [NEAR Social](https://near.social) widgets to interact with the [DevHub smart-contract](https://github.com/near/devgigsboard).
